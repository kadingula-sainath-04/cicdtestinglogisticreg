# Logistic Regression

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv("logit classification.csv")
#this datasset contian information of user and socianl network, those features are - userid,gender,age,salary,purchased
#social network has several business client which can put their into social networks and one of the client is car company , this company has newly lunched XUV in rediculous price or high price
#we will see which of the user in this social network are going to buy brand new xuv car
#Last column tell us user purchased the car yes-1 // no-0 & we are going to build the model that is goint to predict if the user is going to buy xuv or not based on 2 variable based on age & estimated salery
#so our matrix of feature is only these 2 column & we gonna find some corelation b/w age and estimated salary of user and his decission to purchase the car [yes or no]
#so i need 2 index and rest of index i will remove for this i have to use slicing operator
#1 means - the user going to buy the car & 0 means - user is not going to buy the car


X = dataset.iloc[:, [2, 3]].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
#for this observation let me selcted as 100 observaion for test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.20,random_state=0)

#we are going to predict which users are going to predit xuv, 

# Feature Scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler() 
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test) 
#we mentioned feature scaling only to independent variable not dependent variable at all

#datapreprocessing done guys upto this part 

#******************************************************************************************

#Next step is we are going to build the logistic model and appy this model into our dataset 
#This is linear model library thats why we called from sklear.linear_model

# Training the Logistic Regression model on the Training set

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
classifier = LogisticRegression()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
#we have to fit the logistic regression model to our training set

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
#now you compare X_test with y_pred, x-test we have age and salary , 
#if u look at the first observation this user is not be able to buy the car but if you look at observation 7 then that user is going to buy the car
#in this case logistic regression model classify the which users are going to buy the car or not 

#we build our logistic model and fit it to the training set & we predict our test set result 


#now we will use the confusion matrix to evalute

# Making the Confusion Matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(cm)
#we can say that 65 + 24 = 89 correct prediction we found & 8+3 = 11 incorrect prediction made 


# This is to get the Models Accuracy 
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score 
ac = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(ac) 


# This is to get the Classification Report
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
cr = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print(cr)

bias = classifier.score(X_train, y_train)
print(bias)

variance = classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(variance)
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, classification_report

# Compute Metrics
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
ac = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
cr = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
bias = classifier.score(X_train, y_train)
variance = classifier.score(X_test, y_test)

# Print Metrics (for Debugging)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)
print("Accuracy Score:", ac)
print("Classification Report:\n", cr)
print("Bias:", bias)
print("Variance:", variance)
